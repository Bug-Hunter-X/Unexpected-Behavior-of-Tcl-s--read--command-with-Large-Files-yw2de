# Tcl Read Command Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tcl's `read` command when handling large files. The built-in `read` command reads the entire file content into a single string, which can cause memory issues or performance problems for large files.  This example shows the problem and suggests a more robust solution using iterative file reading.

## Bug Description
The primary problem is memory exhaustion or performance degradation when reading large files into memory at once.  Encoding issues can also lead to data corruption.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves iterating through the file line by line, or using a buffered approach to process the file in chunks, reducing memory usage and improving performance.  Proper encoding handling should also be considered.
